On the way to Dandi March, Gandhijee carried a mirror with himself. 
When he reached Dandi, he decided to play a game with the tired people to give them some strength. 
At each turn of the game he pointed out a person and told him to say a number N(possibly huge) of his choice. 
The number was called lucky if that equals it's mirror image.

Input: 
First line contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains a single integer N.
Output: 
For each test case print "YES" if the number was lucky else print "NO" (quotes for clarity) in one line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
0 ≤ N ≤ 10100
